      <h2>Why do you need building compliance?</h2>
      <p>By law, your building is required to have annual compliance certification, and failure to obtain this means that you may incur fines from local councils and/or risk insurance cover. Compliance gives you the knowledge that your tenants will be able to exit a building safely in case of fire.</p>
      <h2>What must be certified?</h2>
      <p>Essential Safety Measures are those fire and safety items installed in a property for the protection of its occupants and the property itself. They comprise &ldquo;active systems&rdquo; such as fire extinguishers, fire hose reels, sprinkler systems and exit &amp; emergency lighting as well as &ldquo;passive systems&rdquo; such as exit doors, paths of travel, and discharge from exits. The Essential Safety Measures in place for any building depends on the age, the size and the design of the property.</p>
      <p> Those buildings constructed after July 1994 must have an Occupancy Permit (OP) issued by the relevant building surveyor. The Essential Safety Measures within the building should be listed on the OP and each will have a maintenance schedule required for its proper upkeep. Pre-1994 buildings do not have to have OPs but they do nonetheless have Safety Measures installed. The maintenance schedules for those items should be determined by reference to Australian Standards and normal practice.</p>

    <h3>AESG Maintenance reports enable long term cost planning. AESG Maintenance reports enable long term cost planning. Planning documents can be set for up to 10 years, and our detailed inspections report on building issues requiring long term solutions or maintenance. The purpose of a maintenance report is to ensure Owners Corporations are able to meet the ongoing common area building repair and replacement costs in a timely manner. The report ensures that your building retains its integrity.  It also deals with defects noted in common areas during inspection, but is not a structural report.</h3>

    <div class="read-more-bt"></div>
    <div class="read-more">
      <h2>Heading 2</h2>
      <p>The Maintenance report does not cover normal maintenance items, ie. window cleaning, gardening and essential safety measures. It does not cover expenditure that occurs as a result of structural defects. It does not cover asbestos reports and all associated costs for uncovering the existence or removal of asbestos. It does not include allowance for upgrades to buildings unless noted by Owner Corporations and requested in the report. It does not include Occupational Health and Safety issues, however AESG do provide a separate OH&amp;S report see OH&amp;S section and Defect reports â€“ See Defects section. </p>
      <h2>Heading 2</h2>
      <p>A Maintenance report enables the Owner Corporation to: ensure there are sufficient funds available to maintain the integrity of the building; be accurate in the financial amount required by unit holders in order to not over contribute to funds; to establish a contingency fund that reflects real costs; provide key cost saving for many Owner Corporations.</p>

      <h2>Fire Door Tagging</h2>
      <p>There is a legal requirement that all Fire Door Assemblies are tagged to show that they have been tested, manufactured and installed in accordance with the performance standard and that they are capable of achieving the stated fire resistance level.</p>
      <p>Where a Fire Door is listed on the OP but does not have a suitable tag, AESG can organise for the appropriate tag to be made available or for a replacement tagged Fire Door to be installed.</p>

      <h2>Fire and Smoke Door Signage</h2>
      <p>Where a building has either Fire Doors or Smoke Doors installed they should each be fitted with the appropriate signage (BCA D2.23).</p>
      <p>AESG can supply and install compliant signage for all of your doors.</p>

      <h2>Why do you need an Occupational Health and Safety check?</h2>
      <p>According to the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, OH&amp;S reports are mandatory in a workplace. The Act requires employers to provide, so far as it is practical, a safe environment and a reduced risk to health for both the public and employees.</p>
      <p>Under the Act, an Owners Corporation is deemed to be an employer and the common areas of a property are considered to be a workplace.</p>
      <p>Significant penalties for non-compliance apply.</p>

        <h2>OH&amp;S Reporting</h2>
        <p>Our OH&amp;S reports cover those areas that are relevant to reducing health and safety risks to the occupants, employees and tenants of your buildings.</p>
        <p>AESG inspectors look at the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Injury Risk</li>
          <li>Essential Safety Measures Risk</li>
          <li>Utilities Risk</li>
          <li>Building Condition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AESG's OH&amp;S reports provide extensive information that helps you achieve a safe environment and reduced risk to occupants, tenants and employees. Our report outlines areas requiring rectification.</p>
        <p>If needed, we can provide a contractor list to assist you.</p>

      <h2>Inspection and Reporting is our Core Business</h2>
      <p>Many organisations that have a large number of sites struggle to ensure that each of their locations are maintaining adherence to the Company&rsquo;s Policies and Procedures. Materials, policies and procedures are typically distributed from a central location, but what happens to them thereafter is difficult to monitor. </p>
      <p> AESG can audit on your behalf. In many instances we will be onsite to inspect your Essential Safety Measures for a small additional cost we can look at the compliance of such things as your First Aid records, your signage, induction procedures or even your Work Safe posters. If you can tell us what it is meant to be, we can check it for you. AESG will tailor an Audit and Report to your specific requirements.</p>

      <div class="read-more">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Our Inspectors will visit your site on a regular basis and check on those things you want to ensure are being maintained. We will inspect each item and detail the condition in which we found it. Where an item is non-compliant AESG will photograph the fault to facilitate rectification.</p>
        <p>Using the power of aBAS, AESG will provide you with access to a real time, online report that shows the status of individual sites, regions or the whole organisation. AESG can become your remote eyes and ears to help you keep your finger on the pulse of the whole organisation.</p>
