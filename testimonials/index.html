  <blockquote><img alt="Freemasons Victoria" src="/assets/img/logos/FreemasonsVictoria.png">
    <p>&ldquo;The United Grand Lodge of Victoria has a responsibility for approximately 150 Masonic Centres and other nominated properties throughout the state of Victoria. The great majority of these Centres were constructed in the early part of the 20th Century, many with historical significance. Management at each of these Centres have the responsibility for the day to day management of these Centres and as such it has been difficult to coordinate the quality of maintenance and compliance with particular reference to the requirements of both Essential Services and Occupational Health &amp; Safety</p>
    <p>The Australian Essential Services Group have been appointed to report and certify our Centres and we have found them to possess both a professional and accommodating approach to ensure that our Centres meet the relevant criteria.&rdquo;</p>
